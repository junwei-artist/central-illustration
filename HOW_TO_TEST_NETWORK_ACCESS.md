# How to Test Network Access

## The Issue
Your browser may have cached the old JavaScript code that uses `localhost`. You need to clear the cache and reload.

## Steps to Fix

### 1. Hard Refresh Your Browser

**Chrome/Edge (Mac):** `Cmd + Shift + R`  
**Chrome/Edge (Windows):** `Ctrl + Shift + R`  
**Firefox:** `Ctrl + F5` or `Cmd + Shift + R`  
**Safari:** `Cmd + Option + R`

**Or:**
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Right-click the refresh button
- Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### 2. Check the Console Logs

After refreshing, open the browser console (F12) and you should see:
```
Login request to: http://YOUR_HOSTNAME/auth/login
```

This will show you the actual URL being used.

### 3. Verify It's Working

Try logging in again and check the Network tab in DevTools:
- Request URL should match your current hostname
- Should see: `http://YOUR_IP:8000/auth/login` (not localhost)

### 4. Test from Another Device

1. Find your computer's IP address:
   ```bash
   ifconfig | grep "inet "
   ```

2. On another device on the same network, open:
   ```
   http://YOUR_IP:3000
   ```

3. Try logging in from the other device

4. Check Network tab - should show requests to `http://YOUR_IP:8000`

## What Changed

- ✅ Frontend now dynamically detects the current hostname
- ✅ API requests use the detected hostname (not hardcoded localhost)
- ✅ Works for localhost, IP addresses, and domains
- ✅ Console logs show the actual URLs being used (for debugging)

## Expected Behavior

**When accessing `http://localhost:3000`:**
- API requests go to: `http://localhost:8000`

**When accessing `http://192.168.1.100:3000`:**
- API requests go to: `http://192.168.1.100:8000`

**When accessing `http://yourdomain.com:3000`:**
- API requests go to: `http://yourdomain.com:8000`

## Still Seeing localhost?

1. Make sure you did a hard refresh
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Try incognito/private window
4. Check the browser console logs
5. Restart the frontend dev server if needed
