# Fix: Demo Status Not Visible to Non-Admin Users

## 🔍 Problem
Admin starts a demo (e.g., Total Quality Management on port 3001), but other clients see it as "not running" because they couldn't check the demo status.

## 🐛 Root Cause
The `/demo-manager/status/{demo_id}` endpoint required admin authentication, so non-admin users couldn't check if a demo was running.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Made Status Endpoint Public
**File**: `backend/api/demo_manager.py`

**Before**:
```python
@router.get("/status/{demo_id}", response_model=Dict)
def get_demo_status(
    demo_id: int,
    current_user = Depends(get_current_admin),  # ❌ Admin-only
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
):
```

**After**:
```python
@router.get("/status/{demo_id}", response_model=Dict)
def get_demo_status(
    demo_id: int,
    request: Request,  # ✅ Now public
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
):
```

### 2. Added Dynamic URL to Status Response
The status endpoint now includes the demo URL using the client's hostname:

```python
if result['status'] == 'running' and result.get('port'):
    client_host = request.headers.get('host', 'localhost').split(':')[0]
    base_url = f"{request.url.scheme}://{client_host}"
    result['url'] = f"{base_url}:{result['port']}"
```

This ensures:
- When admin accesses from `localhost` → gets `http://localhost:3001`
- When user accesses from `192.168.1.16` → gets `http://192.168.1.16:3001`

## 🚀 How to Apply

### Step 1: Restart Backend
**Stop the current backend:**
```bash
# In the terminal running the backend, press Ctrl+C
```

**Start it again:**
```bash
./run-illustration-backend.command
```

Or:
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Step 2: Test the Fix

**On Admin's Device:**
1. Log in as admin
2. Go to demo detail page
3. Click "Start Demo"

**On Another Client's Device:**
1. Open the same demo page (without logging in)
2. Should now see "Running on port 3001" instead of "Not Running"
3. Can click "Launch Demo Project" to open the demo

## ✅ Expected Behavior

### For Admins (localhost):
- ✅ Can start/stop demos
- ✅ Sees demo status
- ✅ Gets correct localhost URLs

### For Non-Admin Users (any IP):
- ✅ Can see demo status (running/stopped)
- ✅ Sees correct port number
- ✅ Gets URLs with their IP address
- ✅ Can click to launch the running demo
- ❌ Cannot start/stop demos (requires admin)

## 🔒 Security

**Public Endpoints** (No auth required):
- `GET /demo-manager/status/{demo_id}` - Check demo status
- `GET /demo-manager/redirect/{demo_id}` - Get demo URL

**Admin Only Endpoints** (Auth required):
- `POST /demo-manager/start/{demo_id}` - Start demo
- `POST /demo-manager/stop/{demo_id}` - Stop demo

This is safe because:
1. Reading demo status doesn't allow any modifications
2. Users can see if demos are running
3. Only admins can control (start/stop) demos

## 🎯 Network Access Flow

```
1. Admin (on 192.168.1.16) starts demo
   → Process runs on backend (port 3001)
   → Status stored in process_manager

2. User (on 192.168.1.50) checks status
   → GET /demo-manager/status/{demo_id}
   → Backend detects client IP from Host header: "192.168.1.50:3000"
   → Returns: { status: "running", port: 3001, url: "http://192.168.1.50:3001" }
   ✅ User sees demo is running

3. User clicks "Launch Demo Project"
   → Opens http://192.168.1.50:3001
   ✅ Demo accessible on their network IP
```

**Note**: The demo must be accessible on the same network. Port 3001 on the server must be accessible from client devices.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Still showing "Not Running"?

1. **Restart backend** - changes won't apply until restart
2. **Check console** - look for errors in browser dev tools
3. **Verify process** - is the demo actually running?
4. **Check firewall** - is port 3001 accessible?

### Demo URL shows wrong IP?

- The URL is based on the client's Host header
- Make sure the frontend and backend are on the same machine
- If behind a proxy, the Host header might be wrong

### Can't access demo from another device?

- Check if the demo port (e.g., 3001) is open in firewall
- Verify you're on the same network
- Try accessing the URL directly: `http://SERVER_IP:3001`

Now all clients can see the demo status, regardless of authentication! 🎉
